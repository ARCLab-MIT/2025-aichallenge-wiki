## Getting started
You can find installation instructions for the development toolkit (devkit) on the [installation page](https://splid-devkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html), and detailed information about the dataset is available on the [dataset page](https://splid-devkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dataset.html).

For those interested in participating in the satellite pattern-of-life identification challenge, please refer to the competition [landing page](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/XXXX/overview) for complete details.

To get acquainted with the SPLID development toolkit, we recommend following these steps:
- <b>Read the SPLID Paper:</b> Start by reading the paper on the [Satellite Pattern-of-Life Characterization Dataset and Benchmark Suite](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374083350_AI_SSA_Challenge_Problem_Satellite_Pattern-of-Life_Characterization_Dataset_and_Benchmark_Suite).
- <b>Explore Dataset Descriptions:</b> Review comprehensive descriptions of the [SPLID dataset](https://splid-devkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dataset.html) to understand its nuances.
- <b>Setup Toolkit and Dataset:</b> Follow the step-by-step instructions provided on the [installation page](https://splid-devkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) to set up the devkit and dataset.
- <b>Tutorials to Get Started:</b> We've prepared tutorials in the [example folder](https://github.com/), each covering essential topics:
    - `data_visualization.ipynb`: This tutorial guides you on loading, manipulating, and visualizing the training data and labels.
    - `heuristic_baseline_solution.ipynb`: Here, you'll find a tutorial demonstrating the baseline heuristic solution. It explains the heuristic approach, illustrates how performance is measured, and provides visualizations of the results.
    - `ml_baseline_solution.ipynb`: This tutorial takes you through the development of the baseline machine learning solution. It describes the training workflow, showcases how performance is assessed, and offers visualizations of the results.
