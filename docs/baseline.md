# Baseline solutions
A [baseline solution](https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/2025-aichallenge-wiki/tree/main/baseline_submissions) will be made available to participants on December 16, 2024. 

This solution will help facilitate the assessment of more advanced AI solutions and help familiarize the participants with the dataset, methodologies, and evaluation pipeline. Participants who are new to the field can leverage the baseline implementation as a starting point and build upon the baseline implementation by iterating on the existing model and experimenting with modifications and incorporating newer AI techniques. 

We also recommend that participants check out [the model this competition drew inspiration from] (https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/2025-aichallenge-devkit.git) to develop a deeper understanding of the atmospheric density forecasting problem.
